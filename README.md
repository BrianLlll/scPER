# scPER
## Introduction
scPER, Estimating the cell Proportions using the single-cell RNA-seq Reference, is a novel approach combining adversarial autoencoder and extreme gradient boosting to robustly estimate the relative compositions of cells and their subtypes in the tumor microenvironment of different cancer types and identify the phenotype-associated subclusters. scPER integrated the scRNA-seq datasets derived from different tumors to construct the comprehensive reference panels of all possible tumor cell types and disentangled the confounders from true signals in the latent space of the adversarial autoencoder model.

## Quick Start

### Preprocess the scRNA-seq data

### Run adversarial autoencoder for the scRNA-seq data

### Embed the bulk sample data

### Estimate the cell proportions in the bulk samples

### Identify the phenotype-associated cell populations
